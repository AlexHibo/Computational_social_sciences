Today's data contains charters, manifestos and working documents all discussing some variations of "ethical AI".
Some of them originate from companies (i.e. Google, Microsoft...), others from non-profits (i.e. the Council of Europe), others from (supra-) national institutions (European Parliament, House of Lords...), and others from citizen groups (#Free AI...). 
They all have in common that they discuss some variant of AI ethics, and are (at least partly) prescriptive: they go beyond describing the state of things and provide recommendations.
This data has been published as a coherent corpus, called MapAIE (Mapping AI Ethics).
