The goal of this lab is to study, with very simple methods, a sample from the [Digital Services Act Transparency Database](https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/dashboard). The database collects moderation decision by online platforms (VLOPs, Very Large Online Platforms), as identified by the [DSA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R2065#enc_1) and the European Commission.

The main goal of the lab is to gain insights on the differentiated moderation practices of social media platforms subject to the DSA's obligations. To do this, we us a stratified sample of the transparency database, filtered to contain 70000 decisions by social media platforms.
